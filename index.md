## Project Statement & Objectives

We live in times of unprecedented technological advancement. One of the greatest developments in
society and culture today are social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter. These vast online
networks are used ubiquitously around the glove for sharing information. Most notably, Twitter was
recently used by "troll" agents with the aim of swaying public opinion and influencing the results
of the election.
